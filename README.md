## ‚ú® Features
- Fortune cookies with coder-type flavors

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## üìö What I Learned
- Reduced API calls by half and improved latency by up to 2 seconds by removing randomized splits between local and remote fetches after evaluating trade-offs.
- Accepted a minor Lighthouse performance trade-off (92%) for larger mobile buttons, prioritizing usability after verifying proportions on real devices.
- Replaced `any` with refined TypeScript types to satisfy the linter and improve type safety.
