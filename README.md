## üåê Live Demo
Crack open a cookie here: [mytechiecookie.com](https://mytechiecookie.com) ‚Äî get daily baked wisdom, humor, and inspiration for developers.

## üìñ Overview
**Deliverable:** A motivational app built with Next.js and TypeScript, offering a mix of custom and AI-generated fortune cookie messages that blend humor, insight, and encouragement for developers.

**Purpose:** To bring developers a smile and a dose of motivation while tackling their coding adventures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js / React.js
- **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript
- **APIs / Libraries:** Hugging Face API (Model: OpenAI GTP-OSS-20b)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## ‚ú® Features
- Fortune cookies flavored by coder types
- Dynamic responses powered by Hugging Face API ([openai/gpt-oss-20b:novita](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b))
- SEO-ready with meta tags, OG / Twitter cards, sitemap, and robots.txt
- Lighthouse scores: 100 (desktop) / 92 (mobile, usability-focused trade-off)
- Custom domain via Vercel deployment
- Mobile-first design with dark mode support and accessible controls
- Playful CSS3 animations: typewriter effect, cookie slip corner flip on hover, and spark effects

## üìö What I Learned
- Reduced API calls by half and improved latency by ~2 seconds by removing randomized splits between local and remote fetches after evaluating trade-offs
- Accepted a minor Lighthouse performance trade-off in favor of larger, more usable mobile buttons after testing proportions on real devices
- Strengthened type safety by replacing `any` with refined TypeScript types to satisfy the linter and improve maintainability
